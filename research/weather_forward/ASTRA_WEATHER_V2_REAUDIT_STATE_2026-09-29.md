C1: In an outcome-blind pre-t0 GO-compatible synthetic design, the frozen model-conditional structured bound can issue U(theta)<theta_ERT while true pooled theta>theta_ERT. Independent positive-tail/negative-core attack: true theta=0.0315, 8,000 replications, false NET_VALUE_EXCLUDED=0.0746, MC 95% interval [0.0689,0.0804], structured-bound coverage=0.8854 [0.8784,0.8924].

EXACT_INVARIANT_TO_CHANGE =
No economic exclusion state or report field may be driven by a tail upper bound unless its declared coverage is valid over the frozen admissible tail outcome class. If that coverage is unavailable, tail-bearing runs remain economically INDETERMINATE for exclusion while confirmatory T2 and information-axis results may still be reported.
